1) Implemented the following algorithms with their respective names as the program names.
   They present in the "code" folder.

	> XY_adaptive
	> XY_static
	> G_static


2) Additional arguments are needed to run the program. All programs follow the same format.
	Eg: >>python xy_adaptive.py <no_of_arms> <dimension_of_arm>

3) If programs exceed more than 50,000 iterations, terminate the program, and restart it.
   Since the values might have diverged. Test on n_arms = k+1, dim_arm = k would give better results.
